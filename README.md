Experimental Plugins 
====================

This repo stores plugins that are built by the Cordova team, but are not supported as "core" plugins. The plugins themselves are in branches of this repo.

The plugins have been moved from subfolders to branches because in Cordova 7, the ":" subfolder syntax will not be supported anymore, thus you can't install plugins from subfolders from URLs. The "#" notation will still be supported to signify what branch to grab the plugin from.

Contributors
============

Please make sure that you are contributing to the right plugin branch or a new branch. All pull requests to the `master` branch will be rejected unless it's a README.md update. New plugin branches should update the `master` branch README.md's `Usage` section.
